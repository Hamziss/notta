# Notta

A simple task manager app I use at work and enhance over time with my personal needs

## Features (this is a WIP)

- **Kanban board** - drag and drop tasks between columns (Todo, In Progress, Completed, Paused)
- **Notes** - Mac Notes-style interface with date grouping
- Command menu (`Cmd+K`) for quick navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts: `G T` (tasks), `G N` (notes), `Ctrl+N` (new item)
- data saved to localStorage

## Run it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Stack

Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Vue Router
